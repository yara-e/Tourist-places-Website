        <h2>Discover</h2>
        <p> Here you can find what you need about tourist attractions wee have alot of places for different tourism type
            <br><br>Types:<br><br> Places of natural beauty such as beaches, tropical island resorts, national parks,
            mountains, deserts and forests, are examples of traditional tourist attractions which people may visit.
            Cultural tourist attractions can include historical places, monuments, ancient temples, zoos, aquaria,
            museums and art galleries, botanical gardens, buildings and structures (such as forts, castles, libraries,
            former prisons, skyscrapers, bridges), theme parks and carnivals, living history museums, public art
            (sculptures, statues, murals), ethnic enclave communities, historic trains and cultural events. Factory
            tours, industrial heritage, creative art and crafts workshops are the object of cultural niches like
            industrial tourism and creative tourism. Many tourist attractions are also landmarks. But sports events such
            as a soccer game, Formula 1 race or sailing regatta can also attract tourists.<br><br> Tourists'
            expectations when visiting a particular place are related to several features of the chosen destination:
            culture, architecture, gastronomy, infrastructure, landscape, events, shopping, etc. These features attract
            people to the destination and contribute to the overall experience of the trip. The ultimate primary purpose
            of attractions is to attract the customer's attention so that they can come to a specific location and
            explore the various attractions on vacation. In the travel and tourism industry, attractions therefore play
            a particularly important role as this attracts tourists from all over the world.<br><br>
            Tourist attractions are also created to capitalize on legends such as a supposed UFO crash site near
            Roswell, New Mexico and the alleged Loch Ness monster sightings in Scotland. Ethnic communities may become
            tourist attractions, such as Chinatowns in the United States and the black British neighborhood of Brixton
            in London, England. Tourists also look for special local culinary experiences such as street kitchens in
            Asian metropolises or the coffeehouse culture in Central Europe. In particular, cultural property and the
            individual places of the UNESCO World Heritage Site have developed into tourist attractions. If too many
            tourists frequent individual places, this can lead to environmental pollution and resistance from the local
            population, such as in Barcelona or Venice. With regard to this whole subject, there are already lists of
            destinations that are not recommended to tourists<br><br>
            There are innumerable lists and reviews of tourist attractions. Visitor statistics, cultural significance,
            beauty or age are used and these always reflect the author's personal assessments. Sometimes it is
            particularly emphasized that this particular tourist attraction has not yet been in the focus of the
            international tourism industry. Some of the sights are internationally known or target the national or local
            market. Some attractions are reserved for the local population or are rarely advertised because the main
            traffic routes and main airports are too far away.<br><br>
            In the United States, owners and marketers of attractions advertise tourist attractions on billboards along
            the sides of highways and roadways, especially in remote areas. Tourist attractions often distribute free
            promotional brochures to be displayed in rest areas, information centers, fast food restaurants, and motel
            rooms or lobbies.<br><br>
            While some tourist attractions provide visitors a memorable experience for a reasonable admission charge or
            even for free, others may be of low quality and overprice their goods and services (such as admission, food,
            and souvenirs) in order to profit excessively from tourists. Such places are commonly known as tourist traps
            Within cities, rides on boats and sightseeing buses are sometimes popular.
