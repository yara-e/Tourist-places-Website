            <p class="nplace">South Shetland Islands</p>
            <P class="place">The spectacular South Shetland Island is one of the most visited sites in Antarctica. The
                island is completely covered in ice and is home to some of the most incredible fjords and glaciers.
                The rocky coastlines, on the other hand, are inhabited by elephant seals and penguins. Eight distinct
                countries maintain research stations on the islands all year round, with the majority of the stations
                being
                located on King George Island. Some of the other well-known islands include Deception Island, which is
                widely popular for being a collapsed yet active volcanic cone.Situated at a distance of 160km north of
                the
                Antarctic Peninsula,
                the spectacular South Shetland Island is one of the most visited sites in Antarctica.</P>

            <P class="nplace"> Antarctic Peninsula</P>
            <P class="place">This is the northernmost part of Antarctica
                and is home to a large array of polar wildlife. It comprises
                iceberg strewn waterways along with narrow passages which are frequented by expedition cruises with
                landings
                made on natural harbours and outlying islands of the Antarctic Peninsula.
                Tourists visit the peninsula for the breathtaking scenery with a combination of expansive skies,
                towering
                glaciers. Apart from being a visual treat to the eyes, the place is also popular
                for penguin rookeries along with cormorant colonies. The migration season offers varied opportunities to
                spot Minke, humpback and killer whales at closer proximity. </P>

            <P class="nplace"> South Georgia</P>
            <P class="place"> South Georgia boasts a narrow and long island that is referred to as the Alps located in
                the
                mid-ocean. Thanks to the rising
                mountains covering much of the land mass, the Alps are named so. Enjoy the most picturesque parts of the
                place with the low-lying grasslands, mighty glaciers
                along with dramatic fjords. With these in abundance, it is undoubtedly one of the most visited sites in
                the
                region. The place is widely visited due to the beaches
                that are thrived by penguin colonies and seals. The photogenic remains of whaling stations along with
                the
                relics make the place a visit-worthy. With the ease of landing on the island, tourism has become
                increasingly popular.</P>

            <P class="place"> A trip to Antarctica is incomplete without cruising along the stunning Lemaire Channel.
                Glaciers, icebergs and sheer cliffs dominate the area
                which lies above the water. With these wonderful creations lying above, humpback whales and behemoths
                lie below. While on your expedition to this gorgeous place,
                keep an eye out for orcas as well. The channel is completely precarious with being 1600m narrow and
                having plenty of loose icebergs. A heaven for the photographers, the scenery offers a breathtaking
                mirror view which is almost a dream to the photographers.</P>

            <P class="place"> A natural harbour located on the north-western shore of Wiencke island is one of the most
                popular places to visit. The tourist spot makes way for being one of the most popular tourist
                destinations for a large array of cruise-ship passengers in Antarctica.
                This is a natural harbour that was originally used for whaling and then in the form of a military base
                during the time of the Second World War. This was soon followed by the place being used as a research
                station. The port is now a historic site consisting of post office and
                museum with being a popular halt point for travellers exploring Antarctica. Half of Wiencke Island is
                now closed for the tourists as only penguins are allowed to thrive.</P>

            <P class="place"> The Drake Passage is an infamous stretch of water. It connects the Atlantic and Pacific
                oceans, passing between the southernmost point of Argentina and the northern tip of the Antarctic
                Peninsula. Named after the famous English explorer Sir Francis Drake, the passage is
                renowned for its strong winds and brutal weather conditions. It's not for the fainthearted and
                seasickness is always a possibility, but it's the only way to navigate to Antarctica from South America.
                Plus, the marvellous open views of rolling ocean and icebergs is worth the journey.</P>

            <P class="nplace">Blood Falls</P>
            <P class="place"> Blood Falls is an outflow of an iron oxide-tainted plume of saltwater, flowing from the
                tongue of Taylor Glacier onto the ice-covered surface of West Lake Bonney in the Taylor Valley of the
                McMurdo Dry Valleys in Victoria Land, East Antarctica. Iron-rich hypersaline water sporadically
                emerges from small fissures in the ice cascades. The saltwater source is a subglacial pool of unknown
                size overlain by about 400 metres of ice several kilometers from its tiny outlet at Blood Falls. The
                reddish deposit was found in 1911 by the Australian geologist Griffith Taylor, who first explored the
                valley that bears his name.
                The Antarctica pioneers first attributed the red color to red algae, but later it was proven to be due
                to iron oxides. </P>

            <P class="place"> Mount Erebus is an active volcano, the second-highest in Antarctica and the southernmost
                active volcano on Earth. It is the sixth-highest ultra mountain on the continent. With a summit
                elevation of 3,794 metres, it is located in the Ross Dependency on Ross Island, which is also home to
                three inactive volcanoes: Mount Terror,
                Mount Bird, and Mount Terra Nova. The volcano has been active since about 1.3 million years ago and has
                a long lived lava lake in its inner summit crater that has been present since at least the early 1970's.
                The volcano was the site of the Air New Zealand Flight 901 accident, which occurred in November 1979.

            <P class="place"> McMurdo Sound and its ice-clogged waters extends about 55 kilometres long and wide. The
                sound connects the Ross Sea to the north with the Ross Ice Shelf cavity to the south via Haskell Strait.
                The strait is largely covered by the McMurdo Ice Shelf. The Royal Society Range rises from sea level to
                4,205 metres on the western shoreline.
                Ross Island, an historic jumping-off point for polar explorers, designates the eastern boundary. The
                active volcano Mount Erebus at 3,794 metres dominates Ross Island. Antarctica's largest scientific base,
                the United States' McMurdo Station, as well as the New Zealand Scott Base are on
                the southern shore of the island. Less than 10 percent of McMurdo Sound's shoreline is free of ice.

                Navy aircraft. In 1961, the Vinson Massif was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names, after
                Carl G. Vinson, United States congressman from the state of Georgia, for his support for Antarctic
                exploration. On November 1, 2006, US-ACAN declared Mount Vinson and Vinson Massif to be separate
                entities. Vinson Massif lies within the Chilean claim under the Antarctic Treaty System. Mount Vinson is
